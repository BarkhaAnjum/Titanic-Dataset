 Titanic-Dataset

Overview
This project is part of my internship task.  
It focuses on data cleaning and preprocessing using the Titanic dataset.

Steps Performed
- Handled missing values:
  - Age → filled with median
  - Embarked → filled with mode
  - Cabin → dropped (too many nulls)
- Encoded categorical variables (Sex, Embarked) using one-hot encoding.
- Scaled numerical features (Age, Fare) using StandardScaler.
- Exported cleaned dataset (`titanic_cleaned.csv`).
