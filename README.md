# 🚢 Titanic Dataset — Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

### 📌 Overview
This project is part of my internship task.  
It focuses on **data cleaning and preprocessing** using the Titanic dataset.

### ✅ Steps Performed
- Handled missing values:
  - Age → filled with median
  - Embarked → filled with mode
  - Cabin → dropped (too many nulls)
- Encoded categorical variables (Sex, Embarked) using one-hot encoding.
- Scaled numerical features (Age, Fare) using StandardScaler.
- Exported cleaned dataset (`titanic_cleaned.csv`).
